- My professional projects at Calico are primarily in private repos which I hope to open-source in the future. The projects largely fit into two buckets:
    - Development of a robust ecosystem for working with mass spectrometry data combining a configurable Dockerized pipeline and R packages supporting the pipeline and downstream analysis.
    - Approaches using genome-scale systems biology to understand regulation. See [Induction Dynamics Expression Atlas](https://idea.research.calicolabs.com/) and [Impulse](https://github.com/calico/impulse).

- My side-projects and past work can be found on [my personal website](http://www.shackett.org). Here is a brief rundown.
